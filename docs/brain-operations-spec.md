This is everything the Telegram bot Baumy (baumy-brain, `@baumy_bot`) needs to
run the household's Olympics for its members: what the household is, how to
call Olympics, and every action it may call. The action list, input schemas,
risks, gates and limits below are generated from Olympics' action registry, so
they are exactly what the endpoint enforces. The short contract is
`docs/brain-integration.md` in baumy-olympics; this doc is the long form.

**Owner rulings (2026-09-28, baumy-olympics issue #70).**

1. Baumy gets **every member action**, the destructive ones included
   (`delete_event`, `delete_note`). A `confirm` or `destructive` action always
   waits for the asker's inline confirm button; a read, or a `safe` write for
   the asker, does not (section 3). Admin actions stay in the Olympics app only
   (SPEC §12 decision 10), except adding and editing a bounty and recording
   money in the pot (amended 2026-09-29, issue #107): those only for a linked
   admin, in their own name, behind the confirm button.
2. **Baumy can act on behalf of housemates.** With `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` the
   action runs as that housemate; the audit trail records both the housemate
   and the linked member who asked. Any write on someone's behalf needs the
   asker's confirm tap, even a `safe` one.

## 1. Calling Olympics

| Method | Path                     | What it does                                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/v1/actions`        | `{ok: true, actions: [{name, title, description, input_schema, kind, risk, member_field?}]}` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/actions/{name}` | Runs one action. The JSON body is its input; an empty body is `{}`.                          |

### Headers

| Header                              | When          | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>`     | always        | `BRAIN_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Olympics stores only its sha256. Missing, unknown or revoked: 401.                                     |
| `X-Baumy-Actor: tg:<telegram id>`   | every `POST`  | The authenticated sender (`from.id`), never text. Mapped to an active member on every call except `link_telegram`.            |
| `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of: <member id>` | optional      | Run the action as this housemate (section 4).                                                                                 |
| `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`              | see section 3 | Send it only from the confirm-tap handler, after the asker tapped. Any other value counts as not confirmed.                   |
| `Idempotency-Key: <key>`            | every write   | 8 to 128 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ : -`, minted once per intended action (when the card is proposed). A retry resends the same key. |

The endpoint checks, in this order: the token and its `brain` scope, 300
calls a minute per token, that the action is offered to Baumy, the actor
header and its link, the on-behalf header, the confirm header, and the
idempotency key. Then the action runs exactly as it would in the app, with
`source=brain`.

### Answers

A success is `200 {ok: true, data}`. A failure is `{ok: false, code, message}`
plus `issues` (with `INVALID_INPUT`), `retryAt` (with `COOLDOWN`) or
`retryAfterSeconds` (with `RATE_LIMITED`, also sent as `Retry-After`).
`message` is a sentence written to be shown to the person as it is.

| Status | `code`                          | What Baumy does                                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `INVALID_INPUT`                 | A bug on our side or a bad slot: `issues` says which field or header. Ask the person to rephrase.             |
| 401    | `UNAUTHENTICATED`               | Olympics is not (correctly) connected. "Baumy Olympics isn't connected to me yet."                            |
| 403    | `FORBIDDEN`                     | Not allowed for this member (for example disputing your own claim). Show `message`.                           |
| 403    | `SURFACE_FORBIDDEN`             | Not Baumy's to do (admin or app-only). "That's done in the Olympics app."                                     |
| 403    | `TELEGRAM_NOT_LINKED`           | "Link your Telegram first: Olympics → Settings → Link Telegram, then tap Start here (or DM me /link <code>)." |
| 404    | `UNKNOWN_ACTION`, `NOT_FOUND`   | No such action, or the thing (event, note, reminder, claim, housemate) is gone. Show `message`.               |
| 409    | `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`          | The key was used for a different call: our bug. Mint a new key and propose again.                             |
| 409    | `IN_PROGRESS`                   | The same key is still running. Retry with the same key in a moment.                                           |
| 422    | domain codes (`COOLDOWN`, …)    | The action understood and said no. Show `message`; each action below lists its own.                           |
| 428    | `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`         | The call needed the confirm tap. Show the card; never retry without a tap.                                    |
| 429    | `RATE_LIMITED`                  | Wait `retryAfterSeconds`.                                                                                     |
| 500    | `INTERNAL`                      | Something broke on Olympics' side. Retry with the same key, then say it is not answering.                     |
| 503    | `NOT_CONFIGURED`, `UNAVAILABLE` | Google Calendar (or brain itself) is not set up or did not answer. Say so; retry later with the same key.     |

### Idempotency

Repeating a write with the same `Idempotency-Key` and the same input returns
the stored answer without running it again. The ledger is keyed on the member
the action runs as, the source and the key. A failed write may be retried with
the same key. A different input under a used key is `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

### Time

The household lives in **Europe/Berlin**. Days (`date`, `from`, `to`) are
Berlin `YYYY-MM-DD`; event times are Berlin wall-clock `HH:MM` (24h). Instants
in answers (`occurredAt`, `retryAt`, `createdAt`, …) are ISO 8601 in UTC:
convert them to Berlin time before showing them. An instant sent to Olympics
(`occurredAt`) must carry its offset. Seasons are Berlin calendar years.

## 2. Linking Telegram (`/link`)

1. The member opens **Settings** in Olympics and taps **Link Telegram**
   (a code of 10 characters, valid 10 minutes, single use).
2. Settings shows it as the deep link `https://t.me/baumy_bot?start=link_<code>`
   (a button and a QR code). Tapping **Start** sends Baumy `/start link_<code>`
   in the member's DM: treat it exactly like `/link <code>`. The fallback is
   DMing `/link <code>`. Refuse `/link` in the group: whoever reads a code first
   could claim it.
3. Baumy calls `link_telegram` `{"code": "<code>"}` with the sender in
   `X-Baumy-Actor` and an `Idempotency-Key` fixed for that message (a retry
   replays the answer instead of spending the code twice). This is the only
   action an unlinked sender may call.
4. The answer is `{memberId, displayName}`: "Linked you as <displayName>."

`LINK_CODE_INVALID` (wrong, used, expired, or its member left) and
`TELEGRAM_ALREADY_LINKED` (another member has this Telegram account; an admin
can clear it) are 422 with a `message` to show.

## 3. Confirmations

Baumy's rule stays: the language model proposes, deterministic code calls
Olympics. Which calls need the asker's tap on an inline confirm button, sent
with `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`:

| Call                                      | Tap needed | Why                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a read (`kind: read`)                     | never      | Nothing changes, for the asker or on anyone's behalf.                             |
| a `safe` write for the asker              | no         | Low stakes and reversible (a note, a reminder, "seen").                           |
| a `confirm` write                         | always     | It changes the score or the shared calendar.                                      |
| a `destructive` write                     | always     | It removes something for everyone. Name the exact thing (title, day) on the card. |
| **any** write with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` | always     | It speaks for someone else.                                                       |

Without the header Olympics answers 428 `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` and nothing
runs. Only the asker's tap resolves the card (the call runs as them, or with
them as the initiator). The tap sends the key minted when the card was
proposed, so a retried tap, or a card reopened after Olympics did not answer,
runs at most once.

## 4. Acting on a housemate's behalf

"Mark the plumber reminder seen for Sam", "Jo says she's seen it", "what's
waiting on Sam?": send `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of: <Sam's member id>`.

- The target must be an **active member of this household**; anyone else is
  404 `NOT_FOUND` ("That person is not an active member of the household.").
  A malformed id is 400.
- The action runs **as the housemate**: their permissions, their idempotency
  ledger, their answer (`whoami` answers as them). The audit row has the
  housemate as the actor, and the asker as `initiated_by_member_id`, with
  `source=brain`.
- Any **write** on someone's behalf needs the asker's tap (section 3). Reads
  do not.
- The asker's own id in the header is the same as no header, for every
  action: the refusals below are only for acting for someone else.
- Not for `link_telegram`, and not for an action that names its member in its
  own input (`member_field` in the tool list): those answer 400. Today that is
  `log_completion`: "Jo did the dishes" is `log_completion` with
  `doneBy: <Jo's id>`. The asker logs it and **vouches** for Jo, so it counts
  at once, and the record says truthfully who logged it. On-behalf would
  claim Jo logged it herself.
- **Never for someone's own word** (403 `FORBIDDEN`, before any confirm
  card): the claim events `dispute_completion`, `undo_completion`,
  `withdraw_dispute` and `concede_completion` (`own_word_only` in the tool
  list). The member has to say it themself, or the honesty layer (nobody
  disputes in someone else's name) would mean nothing.
  Tell the asker the housemate has to do it. Notes, reminders, calendar
  events and the rest do work on a housemate's behalf.
- Admin actions stay unavailable, on anyone's behalf. The three admin writes
  brain gets (`create_bounty`, `update_bounty`, `add_pot_contribution`) run
  only for a linked admin in their own name (`admin_only` in the tool list):
  a member gets 403 `FORBIDDEN`, and `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` is refused with
  403 "Admin changes can't be made on someone's behalf."
- To turn a name into a member id, read the roster: `list_reminders` answers
  `members` (id, name) for every active member; `get_standings` lists them
  with their points. Match the name to exactly one member, or ask.

## 5. The household, as Olympics models it

- **Members.** Each housemate is a member with a display name, a colour and a
  gallery character, if picked. One or more are admins; admin work happens in the app,
  except adding or editing a bounty and recording pot money, which an admin
  may ask Baumy for.
  Nobody is hard-coded: always read names from Olympics.
- **Bounties are chores.** Each chore has a `kind`: `consumable` (buy or
  refill: toilet paper, dish soap) or `maintenance` (clean or fix: trash,
  bathroom). It has base points and a cooldown. `urgent` means overdue on
  its own rhythm: its last completion plus the larger of its interval and
  its cooldown has passed, or falls before midnight in Berlin. A chore never
  done is never urgent, only available (and new, if recent). `isNew` means
  added in the last 3 days. Logging a chore inside its cooldown is refused
  (`COOLDOWN`, with `retryAt`).
- **Streaks and break bonuses.** Each chore has one streak holder. Doing a
  chore again while you hold it grows the streak (+25% of base per step, no
  cap). Doing a chore someone else holds **breaks** their streak: you get a
  break bonus (20% of base per broken step, capped at 10 steps) and start your
  own at 1. Nobody loses points; scores only go up. Streaks reset on 1 January
  (a season is a Berlin calendar year).
- **Points and the pot.** Season points are scored completions plus approved
  adjustments. The pot is a savings ledger in euro cents; the leader at the
  end of the season takes it all (money moves at the bank, not in Olympics).
- **The 24-hour dispute window.** There is no confirming chores (owner,
  2026-10-02): a self-claim is `pending`, counts at once and finalizes 24
  hours after logging, unless someone disputes it inside those 24 hours (a
  dispute needs a reason). Logging for someone else verifies the claim at
  once. A disputed claim scores nothing; it is voided when the window ends
  unless the doer attached a photo in time. The disputer can withdraw, the
  doer can concede, and the logger can undo within 10 minutes.
  `get_activity` is the activity log: what happened in the house, newest
  first.
- **Weights.** Every week Olympics suggests new points for chores from how
  often they are really done. An admin schedules a change; any other member
  may veto it before it applies (next Monday, 00:00 Berlin, at least 48 hours
  ahead).
- **Reminders** are full-screen messages on the kitchen screen, for things
  everyone must read. Each shows every member's character with a Seen button.
  It stays until every member who had joined when it was posted has seen it,
  or someone dismisses it. These are not Baumy's own timed Telegram
  reminders; those stay in Baumy.
- **Notes** are the household message board: a title, a short markdown body,
  a colour, and pinned ones on the kitchen screen. Never put a secret in a
  note; Baumy keeps secrets encrypted itself.
- **Calendar.** The house Google Calendar. Events are timed or all day, in
  Berlin days and times. Private events are never shown.
- **Shopping** is Baumy's own list (`baumy_list_items`). Olympics shows it on
  the kitchen screen by calling Baumy's kitchen API; Baumy never needs to call
  Olympics to change it.

## 7. The actions

### `whoami`: Who am I

Says which household member Baumy is acting as.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `read` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away, on anyone's behalf too |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Before a write, to check the sender is linked (an unlinked sender gets TELEGRAM_NOT_LINKED here, before any confirm card), and to learn their member id and name.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Returns the household member making this request: their member id, display name, role (admin or member), colour and avatar sprite. Use it to learn who 'me' is before acting for them.

**Examples.**

- "who am I in the Olympics?" → `whoami {}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `memberId`, `displayName`, `role` (admin or member), `color`, `avatarSprite` and `actorKind` (always `service` for brain).

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** Nothing, unless asked. If asked: "You're linked as <displayName>."

### `link_telegram`: Link a Telegram account

Links the sender's Telegram account to the member who created the code in Olympics' Settings.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away |
| Who may | the service token alone; the member comes from the code, so an unlinked sender may call it |
| On a housemate's behalf | no: linking is always for the sender |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 5 per Telegram user and 30 per IP in 10 minutes |

**When to use it.** Only for `/link <code>` sent in a DM, or `/start link_<code>` (the Settings deep link, the same thing). Refuse it in the group: anyone who reads a code there could claim it first.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Links the calling Telegram user to the household member who created the one-time link code in Baumy's Settings. Call it when someone sends /link <code>, or /start link_<code> from the Settings deep link.

**Examples.**

- "/link K7PQ2MX9RT" → `link_telegram {"code": "K7PQ2MX9RT"}`
- "/start link_K7PQ2MX9RT" → `link_telegram {"code": "K7PQ2MX9RT"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "code": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 8,
      "maxLength": 32,
      "pattern": "^[A-Za-z0-9]+$"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "code"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `memberId` and `displayName` of the member the account is now linked to.

**Its errors:** `LINK_CODE_INVALID` (422), `TELEGRAM_ALREADY_LINKED` (422). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Linked you as <displayName>." On LINK_CODE_INVALID: "That code didn't work. Make a new one in Olympics → Settings (it lasts 10 minutes)." On TELEGRAM_ALREADY_LINKED: show `message`.

### `approve_login`: Approve a sign-in

Approves a 'Sign in with Baumy' request with the number the member tapped in the approval DM.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | the member themself: brain counts as the member (the kiosk would need their PIN) |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (403 `FORBIDDEN`): only the member themself may, since it is their own word; ask them to do it in the app or in Telegram |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 10 per Telegram user and 60 per IP in 10 minutes |

**When to use it.** ONLY from the number buttons of the approval DM (`POST /api/kitchen/login-approval` asked for it), as the member who tapped. Never from a conversation, never from the LLM, never on anyone's behalf: the number proves the person holding the phone is looking at the sign-in screen. Send the tapped number as it is; Olympics decides whether it is the right one.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Approves a 'Sign in with Baumy' request with the number the member tapped in the DM Baumy sent them. Only from that DM's buttons, never from a conversation. A number that is not the one on the sign-in screen blocks the sign-in.

**Examples.**

- "(taps 47 on the approval DM)" → `approve_login {"requestId": "<from the DM request>", "code": 47}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "requestId": {

    "code"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `outcome`: `approved` (the browser signs in now) or `blocked` (that was not the number on the screen, so the sign-in was refused and Sign in with Baumy is off for this member for 15 minutes); `device`, e.g. `Chrome on macOS`; `purpose`: `sign_in`, or `step_up` when the DM was a "Confirm it's you" request (`purpose: "step_up"` in the login-approval call): the member is already signed in on that device and is confirming a sensitive change there (issue #135). Approving one signs nobody in.

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404), `INVALID_STATE` (422). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** Edit the DM, dropping the buttons. approved: "✅ Signed in on <device>." (`step_up`: "✅ Confirmed it's you on <device>.") blocked: "🚫 That wasn't the number on the screen, so I blocked this sign-in. If it wasn't you, nothing happened; sign in with your password if it was." (`step_up`: "🚫 That wasn't the number on the screen, so I didn't confirm it.") NOT_FOUND or INVALID_STATE: show `message`.

### `deny_login`: Deny a sign-in

Denies a 'Sign in with Baumy' request: the member tapped Deny.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away |
| Who may | the member themself: brain counts as the member (the kiosk would need their PIN) |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (403 `FORBIDDEN`): only the member themself may, since it is their own word; ask them to do it in the app or in Telegram |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 10 per Telegram user and 60 per IP in 10 minutes |

**When to use it.** ONLY from the Deny button of the approval DM, as the member who tapped. Never from a conversation.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Denies a 'Sign in with Baumy' request: the member tapped Deny in the DM Baumy sent them. Only from that DM's buttons.

**Examples.**

- "(taps Deny on the approval DM)" → `deny_login {"requestId": "<from the DM request>"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "requestId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "pattern": "^([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[89abAB][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff)$"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "requestId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `outcome`: `denied` (Sign in with Baumy is then off for this member for 15 minutes); `device`; `purpose` (`sign_in` or `step_up`, as for approve_login).

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404), `INVALID_STATE` (422). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** Edit the DM, dropping the buttons: "✖️ Denied the sign-in on <device>." (`step_up`: "✖️ Didn't confirm it on <device>.") NOT_FOUND or INVALID_STATE: show `message`.

### `list_chores`: List chores

Lists the bounties (chores): what is due, urgent or new, and what each would score now.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `read` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away, on anyone's behalf too |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** To answer "what needs doing?", and to turn a chore someone names into its `choreId` before log_completion. Match the words to exactly one chore; if none or several match, list them and ask.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Lists the household's chores with their ids, kind (consumable: buy or refill; maintenance: clean or fix), base points, cooldown, who holds each chore's streak this season and how long it is, whether each is due, cooling down (with availableAt) or done for now, `urgent` (overdue on its own rhythm: its last completion plus the larger of its interval and its cooldown has passed, or falls before midnight in Berlin; a chore never done is never urgent), `isNew` (added in the last 3 days), `createdAt`, and `next`: what logging it right now would score for you (total points, streak length, break bonus). Times are ISO 8601 in UTC; the household lives in Europe/Berlin. Archived chores are left out unless includeArchived is true.

**Examples.**

- "what needs doing?" → `list_chores {}`
- "what's urgent?" → `list_chores {} (keep `urgent: true`)`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "includeArchived": {
      "description": "Also list archived chores. Default false.",
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `chores`: each one's `id`, `name`, `kind` (consumable or maintenance), `basePoints`, `cooldownMinutes`, `state` (due, cooling down with `availableAt`, or done for now; a chore never done is `due` with no `dueAt`), `urgent` (overdue on its own rhythm; never for a chore never done), `isNew`, `streak` (holder and length) and `next` (what logging it now would score the asker).

**Its errors:** none of its own. Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** Urgent ones first, then due, then the rest; say points as "+N". Times in Berlin time.

### `log_completion`: Log a chore

Logs that someone did a chore, and scores it.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (400): name the housemate in `doneBy` instead |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** When someone says they (or a named housemate) did a chore. For "Jo did the dishes", send `doneBy: <Jo's id>`: the asker logs it and vouches for Jo, so it counts at once. Never use X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of for this (it is refused with 400): that would claim Jo logged it herself.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Logs that a household member did a chore and scores it (streaks and break bonuses). doneBy defaults to you; logging for someone else vouches for them. Refused with COOLDOWN (and retryAt) if the chore was done too recently, and with other codes for times in the future, more than 24h ago, or before the chore's last completion. Get chore and member ids from list_chores and whoami.

**Examples.**

- "I took the trash out" → `log_completion {"choreId": "<Trash, from list_chores>"}`
- "Jo did the dishes last night at 11" → `log_completion {"choreId": "<Dishes>", "doneBy": "<Jo's member id>", "occurredAt": "2026-09-27T23:00:00+02:00"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

      "maxLength": 280
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "choreId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `completionId`, `choreName`, `doneBy`/`doneByName`, `status`, `totalPts`, `streakLen`, and a break (`breakPts`, `brokenMemberName`, `brokenLen`) if one happened.

**Its errors:** `COOLDOWN` (422), `FUTURE` (422), `BACKDATE_TOO_FAR` (422), `OUT_OF_ORDER` (422), `SEASON_CLOSED` (422), `PHOTO_REQUIRED` (422), `ARCHIVED_CHORE` (422), `NO_RULE_VERSION` (422), `NOT_FOUND` (404). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Logged <choreName> for <doneByName>: +<totalPts> (streak <streakLen>)", plus "and broke <brokenMemberName>'s streak of <brokenLen> for +<breakPts>" when there was a break. On COOLDOWN say when it can be logged again (`retryAt`, in Berlin time). On PHOTO_REQUIRED: "that one needs a photo, log it in the app".

### `create_bounty`: Add a bounty

Adds a bounty (a chore that scores points) to the board, as an admin.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | a linked admin, in their own name only (a member gets 403 `FORBIDDEN`) |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (403 `FORBIDDEN`): an admin change is only ever made in the admin's own name |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Only when an admin asks for a new bounty. A non-admin gets FORBIDDEN: say an admin adds it. Give a name and points; the rest has defaults (maintenance, 24 h cooldown, no photo, counts at once).

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Adds a bounty (a household chore that scores points) to the board: its name, kind (consumable or maintenance, default maintenance), base points, cooldown in hours (default 24), proof mode (default none) and effort factor (default 100). Only a household admin may do this, in their own name.

**Examples.**

- "add a bounty for recycling paper, 15 points" → `create_bounty {"name": "Recycling (paper)", "points": 15}`
- "new bounty: buy dish soap, 10 points" → `create_bounty {"name": "Dish soap", "kind": "consumable", "points": 10}`

**Returns** (`data`): `choreId` and `name` of the new bounty.

**Its errors:** `CHORE_NAME_TAKEN` (422). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Added the <name> bounty: <points> points."

### `update_bounty`: Edit a bounty

Edits a bounty as an admin: only the fields sent change. A new weight counts from now.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | a linked admin, in their own name only (a member gets 403 `FORBIDDEN`) |

**When to use it.** Only when an admin asks to change a bounty's name, kind, points, cooldown or photo rule. Find the `choreId` with list_chores. Archiving is done in the app.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Edits a bounty on the board (choreId from the context or list_chores): only the fields given change (name, kind, base points, cooldown in hours, proof mode, effort factor). A new weight counts from now; nothing already scored changes. Only a household admin may do this, in their own name.

**Examples.**

- "make the trash worth 30 points" → `update_bounty {"choreId": "<from list_chores>", "points": 30}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",

**Say back:** "Done: <name> is now <what changed>."

### `get_activity`: Activity log

The activity log: what happened in the house in the last 30 days, newest first (chores logged, disputes, bounties added or edited, points changes scheduled, applied or vetoed), and what the asker may do to each.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `read` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away, on anyone's behalf too |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For "what happened today?" or "what did Sam log?", and to find the `completionId` before disputing, undoing, withdrawing or conceding. Use `can` (and `canVeto` on a scheduled points change) to offer only what is allowed. There is no confirming: a self-claim counts at once and settles when its 24-hour window ends.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Lists what happened in the house in the last 30 days, newest first: chores logged (who did and logged each, its status, points, any open dispute and when its dispute window ends), disputes raised and how they ended, bounties added or edited, and points changes scheduled, applied or vetoed. A chore entry's `can` says which of dispute, withdraw, concede, undo and attach a photo you may do to it now; a scheduled points change's `canVeto` says whether you may veto it. Times are ISO 8601 in UTC.

**Examples.**

- "what's been happening?" → `get_activity {}`
- "anything I can still dispute?" → `get_activity {}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "limit": {
      "description": "At most this many entries (default 50).",
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 100
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `entries`, newest first, each with a `kind`: `chore` (who did and logged it, `status`, `totalPts`, any open `dispute`, `windowEndsAt` and `can`), `dispute` (who raised it, the reason and its `resolution`), `bounty` (`added` or `edited`, and by whom) or `points` (`scheduled`, `applied` or `vetoed`, from and to, and `canVeto`); and `days`, how far back it reads.

**Its errors:** none of its own. Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** A few lines, newest first, each as "<who> <did what> <when>", with the actions `can` allows on the ones the asker may act on.

### `dispute_completion`: Dispute a chore

Disputes a housemate's self-claimed chore inside its 24-hour window, with a reason.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | the member themself: brain counts as the member (the kiosk would need their PIN) |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (403 `FORBIDDEN`): only the member themself may, since it is their own word; ask them to do it in the app or in Telegram |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** When someone says a claimed chore was not done. Ask for the reason if none was given; it is required. Find the `completionId` with get_activity.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Disputes a housemate's self-claimed chore within 24 hours of logging, with a reason. Get ids from get_activity. While disputed it scores nothing but still blocks the chore's cooldown. It is voided when the window ends unless the doer attached a photo in time. You cannot dispute your own.

**Examples.**

- "Sam didn't do the bathroom, it's still dirty" → `dispute_completion {"completionId": "<id>", "reason": "Still dirty"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "completionId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "pattern": "^([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[89abAB][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff)$",
      "description": "The completion's id, from get_activity."
    },
    "reason": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 280,
      "description": "Why you think it was not done."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "completionId",
    "reason"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `completionId`, `choreName`, the new `status` (disputed).

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404), `INVALID_STATE` (422), `WINDOW_CLOSED` (422), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `REASON_REQUIRED` (422). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Disputed <doer>'s <choreName>. It scores nothing unless they attach a photo in time or you withdraw it."

### `undo_completion`: Undo a logged chore

Undoes a chore the asker logged, within 10 minutes of logging it.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | no (403 `FORBIDDEN`): only the member themself may, since it is their own word; ask them to do it in the app or in Telegram |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For "oops, undo that" right after a log. After 10 minutes it is WINDOW_CLOSED; say so.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Undoes a chore you logged yourself, within 10 minutes of logging it. It is voided and scores nothing. Refused with WINDOW_CLOSED after 10 minutes and FORBIDDEN for anyone but the person who logged it.

**Examples.**

- "undo that, wrong chore" → `undo_completion {"completionId": "<the one just logged>"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "completionId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "pattern": "^([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[89abAB][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff)$",
      "description": "The completion's id, from get_activity."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "completionId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false

| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Only when an admin says they (or a named housemate) paid into the pot. A non-admin gets FORBIDDEN: say an admin records it. Leave `month` out for this month; set `contributedBy` to a member id when someone else paid.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Records a monthly contribution to the season's savings pot: the amount in euros, the month (YYYY-MM, default: this month), who paid it (a member id, default: you) and an optional note. Only a household admin may do this, in their own name.

**When to use it.** When someone objects to a scheduled change. Use `canVeto` from get_weights first; the scheduler cannot veto their own change.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Vetoes a scheduled weight change before it applies. Only a member other than the one who scheduled it can veto it; a vetoed change never applies.

**Examples.**

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Adds an event to the house calendar. Dates are Berlin days (YYYY-MM-DD) and times Berlin wall-clock times (HH:MM, 24h); give startTime and endTime for a `timed` event, or kind `all_day`. endDate is the last day, inclusive, and defaults to date. forMemberId names the one member it is for; leave it out (or null) for the whole house.

**Its errors:** `INVALID_INPUT` (400), `NOT_CONFIGURED` (503), `UNAVAILABLE` (503). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Added <title> on <day> <time>."

### `update_event`: Change a calendar event

Changes a calendar event; every field is replaced.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` and the asker's confirm tap |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |
| Calls out | yes (Google or brain): may answer 503 `NOT_CONFIGURED` or `UNAVAILABLE` |

**When to use it.** When someone moves or renames an event. Read it with list_events and send ALL its fields, changed and unchanged. Leave `forMemberId` out to keep who it is for; send a member id to change it, or null to make it the whole house's.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Changes an event on the house calendar: send its id (from list_events) and ALL of its fields as they should be, the same as for create_event, except forMemberId: leave it out to keep who it is for, or null to make it the whole house's.

**Examples.**

- "move dinner with Anna to 20:00" → `update_event {"eventId": "<id>", "title": "Dinner with Anna", "kind": "timed", "date": "2026-10-03", "startTime": "20:00", "endTime": "21:00"}`

| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` and the asker's confirm tap |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Only when someone clearly asks to remove an event. Name the exact event (title and day) on the confirm card.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Deletes an event from the house calendar, by its id from list_events. Always confirm with the person first.

**Examples.**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "eventId": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[A-Za-z0-9_]{5,1024}$",

### `list_notes`: Notes

The household message board.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `read` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away, on anyone's behalf too |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For "what's on the board?", and to find a `noteId` before changing, pinning or deleting a note.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Lists the household's notes, pinned ones first and then the most recently changed, each with its id, title, markdown body, colour, whether it is pinned to the hub, who wrote it (member id and name) and when it was created, last changed and last edited (editedAt: its words; pinning is not an edit) (ISO 8601, UTC), and `recentCount`: how many notes were added or edited in the last 24 hours. Notes are shared household text, never secrets.

**Examples.**

- "what's pinned on the board?" → `list_notes {"pinnedOnly": true}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "pinnedOnly": {
      "description": "Only the pinned notes (the hub shows these). Default false.",
      "anyOf": [

      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 100
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `notes`: id, title, markdown body, colour, pinned, author, created and changed times.

**Its errors:** none of its own. Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** Titles first, pinned ones marked; the body only when asked.

### `create_note`: Add a note

Posts a note on the household message board.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away for the asker; on a housemate's behalf it needs `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1` |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` and the asker's confirm tap |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For "put a note up: …". Never put a secret (door code, wifi password, bank details) in a note; brain keeps those encrypted itself. For something everyone must see now, create_reminder is better.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Adds a note for the household: a short title, an optional markdown body (bold, italic, lists, links), an optional colour and whether to pin it to the hub and the kitchen screen. Never put secrets (passwords, codes that unlock anything) in a note.

**Examples.**

- "put a note up: recycling goes out on Tuesdays" → `create_note {"title": "Recycling", "bodyMd": "Goes out on **Tuesdays**."}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 80,
      "description": "A short title."
    },

      "description": "The note itself, in markdown (bold, italic, lists, links). Optional.",
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 2000
    },
    "color": {
      "description": "The note's colour, or \"none\". Default none.",
      "anyOf": [
        {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": [
            "yellow",
            "pink",
            "blue",
            "green",
            "orange",

        }

      "anyOf": [
        {
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        {

            "true",
            "false",
            "on"

      ]
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "title"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `note`: the note as stored, with its `id`.

**Its errors:** none of its own. Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Posted <title> on the board."

### `update_note`: Change a note

Rewrites a note: title, body and colour are all replaced.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |

| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |

**When to use it.** When someone changes a note. Read it first and send the whole note; a body or colour left out is emptied.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Rewrites a note: its title, markdown body and colour are all replaced, so send the whole note (a body or colour left out is emptied). Pinning is pin_note. Anyone in the household may change any note.

**Examples.**

- "change the recycling note to Wednesdays" → `update_note {"noteId": "<id>", "title": "Recycling", "bodyMd": "Goes out on **Wednesdays**."}`

### `pin_note`: Pin a note

Pins a note to the hub and the kitchen screen, or unpins it.

The house shopping list, as the kitchen screen shows it. The list is brain's own, so this reads brain back through Olympics.

| Risk | `safe`: runs straight away, on anyone's behalf too |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` |
| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Almost never: brain has the list itself (`baumy_list_items`). It exists so every surface can read it.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Lists what is on the house shopping list (the same list the house Telegram group keeps with Baumy), oldest first: each item's id, its name and when it was added (ISO 8601, UTC).

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

| Who may | any linked member |

| `Idempotency-Key` | not needed |
| Rate limit | 120 per Telegram user and 300 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For "any reminders up?" and "who hasn't seen the plumber one?". Its `members` is also the roster: use it to turn a housemate's name into the member id for X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of or `doneBy`.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Lists the household's active reminders (posted, and neither dismissed nor seen by every member yet), the oldest first, each with its id, title, body, who posted it, when (ISO 8601, UTC), the member ids who have seen it and those still to see it; and the active members (id, name, colour, and their gallery character if they picked one).

**Examples.**

- "who hasn't seen the plumber reminder?" → `list_reminders {}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {},
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `members` (id, `displayName`, `color`, and `sprites`: their gallery character, or null) and `reminders` (id, title, body, who posted it, when, `seenBy`, `waitingFor`).

**Say back:** "<title>: still waiting for <names of waitingFor>." Name people, never ids.

### `create_reminder`: Post a reminder

Posts a full-screen reminder on the kitchen screen until every member has seen it.

| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** For something everyone must read (a tradesperson coming, the water off). Not for chores (list_chores) or lasting info (create_note). This is not brain's own timed Telegram reminder: it has no time, it shows now.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Posts a reminder for the whole household: a short title and an optional plain-text body of a sentence or two. The kitchen screen shows it full-screen until every member has tapped Seen, or someone dismisses it. For things everyone must read (a tradesperson coming, the water off), not for chores or notes.

**Examples.**

- "put up a reminder: plumber Wednesday 9am, leave the door unlocked" → `create_reminder {"title": "Plumber Wednesday 9:00", "body": "Leave the door unlocked."}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

    }
  },
  "required": [
    "title"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `reminderId` and `title`.

**Its errors:** none of its own. Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "It's on the kitchen screen until everyone taps Seen."

**When to use it.** For "seen it" / "got it" about a reminder. "Mark it seen for Sam" is X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of: <Sam's id>, which needs the asker's confirm tap.

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Records that you have read a reminder. Once every member has, it leaves the kitchen screen for good. Seeing it twice changes nothing.

**Examples.**

- "seen the plumber one" → `acknowledge_reminder {"reminderId": "<id>"}`
- "mark the plumber reminder seen for Sam, he knows" → `acknowledge_reminder {"reminderId": "<id>"} with X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of: <Sam's id>`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "reminderId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "pattern": "^([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[89abAB][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff)$",
      "description": "The reminder's id, from list_reminders."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "reminderId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `reminderId`, `memberId` (who it was marked for) and `seenByEveryone`.

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Marked seen." Add "Everyone has seen it now, it's off the screen." when `seenByEveryone`.

### `dismiss_reminder`: Dismiss a reminder

Takes a reminder off the kitchen screen for everyone, seen or not.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `write` |
| Risk | `confirm`: always send `X-Baumy-Confirmed: 1`, only after the asker tapped the confirm button (428 without it) |
| Who may | any linked member |
| On a housemate's behalf | yes, with `X-Baumy-On-Behalf-Of` and the asker's confirm tap |
| `Idempotency-Key` | required; the same key again replays |
| Rate limit | 30 per Telegram user and 120 per IP in a minute |

**When to use it.** Only when someone asks to take it down (it's no longer true, or it was a mistake).

**Tool description** (the registry's, verbatim): Takes a reminder off the kitchen screen for everyone, whether or not everyone has seen it. Ask first.

**Examples.**

- "take the plumber reminder down" → `dismiss_reminder {"reminderId": "<id>"}`

**Input** (JSON Schema of the body):

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "reminderId": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uuid",
      "pattern": "^([0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[89abAB][0-9a-fA-F]{3}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff)$",
      "description": "The reminder's id, from list_reminders."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "reminderId"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Returns** (`data`): `reminderId` and `title`.

**Its errors:** `NOT_FOUND` (404). Every call can also get the endpoint's codes (above).

**Say back:** "Took <title> off the kitchen screen."
